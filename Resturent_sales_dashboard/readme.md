# 🍽️ Restaurant Sales Dashboard  

## 📋 Project Overview  
This project is based on restaurant sales data where I manually typed **60–70 rows** of raw data from a PDF file.  
After entering the data, I cleaned, formatted, and transformed it in Excel to make it ready for analysis.  
Finally, I created an **interactive dashboard** to visualize key insights and performance metrics.
